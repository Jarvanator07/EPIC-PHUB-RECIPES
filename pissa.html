          <h2>Method:</h2>
          <h3>Making the Pizza Dough</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>Proof the yeast:
              Place the warm water in the large bowl of a heavy duty stand mixer.<br> 
              Sprinkle the yeast over the warm water and let it sit for 5 minutes until the yeast is dissolved.<br> 
              After 5 minutes stir if the yeast hasn't dissolved completely. <br> 
              The yeast should begin to foam or bloom, indicating that the yeast is still active and alive.<br> 
              (Note that if you are using "instant yeast" instead of "active yeast", no proofing is required. <br> 
              Just add to the flour in the next step.)</li>
            <li>Make and knead the pizza dough:
              Add the flour, salt, sugar, and olive oil, and using the mixing paddle attachment, mix on low speed for a minute.<br> 
              Then replace the mixing paddle with the dough hook attachment.<br> 
              Knead the pizza dough on low to medium speed using the dough hook about 7-10 minutes.<br> 
              If you don't have a mixer, you can mix the ingredients together and knead them by hand.<br> 
              The dough should be a little sticky, or tacky to the touch. If it's too wet, sprinkle in a little more flour.</li>
            <li>Let the dough rise:
              Spread a thin layer of olive oil over the inside of a large bowl.<br>
              Place the pizza dough in the bowl and turn it around so that it gets coated with the oil.<br>
              At this point you can choose how long you want the dough to ferment and rise.<br>
              A slow fermentation (24 hours in the fridge) will result in more complex flavors in the dough.<br>
              A quick fermentation (1 1/2 hours in a warm place) will allow the dough to rise sufficiently to work with.<br>
              Cover the dough with plastic wrap.<br>
              For a quick rise, place the dough in a warm place (75°F to 85°F) for 1 1/2 hours.<br>
              For a medium rise, place the dough in a regular room temperature place (your kitchen counter will do fine) for 8 hours.<br> 
              For a longer rise, chill the dough in the refrigerator for 24 hours (no more than 48 hours).<br>
              The longer the rise (to a point) the better the flavor the crust will have.</li>    
              
          </ol>
             <h3>Preparing the Pizzas</h3>  
          <ol>  
              <li>Preheat the pizza stone (or pizza pan or baking sheet): <br>
                Place a pizza stone on a rack in the lower third of your oven. <br>
                Preheat the oven to 475°F for at least 30 minutes, preferably an hour. <br>
                If you don't have a pizza stone, you can use a pizza pan or a thick baking sheet; you need something that will not warp at high temperatures.</li>  
              <li>Divide the dough into 2 balls:
                Remove the plastic cover from the dough.<br>
                Dust your hands with flour and push the dough down so it deflates a bit. <br>
                Divide the dough in half.<br>
                Form 2 round balls of dough.<br>
                Place each in its own bowl, cover with plastic and let sit for 15 minutes (or up to 2 hours).</li> 
              <li>Prep the toppings:
                Prepare your desired toppings.<br>
                Note that you are not going to want to load up each pizza with a lot of toppings as the crust will end up not crisp that way.<br>
                About a third a cup each of tomato sauce and cheese would be sufficient for one pizza. <br>
                One to two mushrooms thinly sliced will cover a pizza.</li> 
              <li>Flatten the dough ball, and stretch out into a round:<br>
                Working one ball of dough at a time, <br>
                take one ball of dough and flatten it with your hands on a lightly floured work surface.<br>
                Starting at the center and working outwards, <br>
                use your fingertips to press the dough to 1/2-inch thick. <br>
                Turn and stretch the dough until it will not stretch further.<br>
                Let the dough relax 5 minutes and then continue to stretch it until it reaches the desired diameter—10 to 12 inches<br>
                Treat the dough gently!<br>
                You can also hold up the edges of the dough with your fingers, <br>
                letting the dough hang and stretch, while working around the edges of the dough.<br>
                If a hole appears in your dough, <br>
                place the dough on a floured surface and push the dough back together to seal the hole.<br>
                Use your palm to flatten the edge of the dough where it is thicker. <br>
                Pinch the edges if you want to form a lip.</li> 
              <li>Brush the dough top with olive oil:<br>
                Use your fingertips to press down and make dents along the surface of the dough to prevent bubbling. <br>
                Brush the top of the dough with olive oil (to prevent it from getting soggy from the toppings).<br>
                Let rest another 10 to 15 minutes.<br>
                Repeat with the second ball of dough.</li> 
              <li>Sprinkle the pizza peel with cornmeal, put flattened dough on top:<br>
                Lightly sprinkle your pizza peel (or flat baking sheet) with cornmeal.<br>
                (The corn meal will act as little ball bearings to help move the pizza from the pizza peel into the oven.)<br>
                Transfer one prepared flattened dough to the pizza peel.<br>
                If the dough has lost its shape in the transfer, lightly shape it to the desired dimensions.</li>
